Before directly jump on to H&R topic, we firstly learn some basics about Props.

* ABOUT PROPS
  - Props is simply abbreviation of "**Properties**".
  - It showing how components are talk to each other.
  - It always flow downwards from the Parents component.
  - There is also the case that you can have default props so that props are set even if a parent component doesn't pass props down.
